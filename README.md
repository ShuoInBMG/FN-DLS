# SFN-DLS  
> **S**tranded **F**ibrous **N**etwork **D**eep **L**earning **S**ystem  

Automated extraction, digital reconstruction and mechanical analysis of stranded fibrous networks from AFM images, as described in paper  
**“Hierarchical Silk Fibroin Nanofibril Networks Exhibit Structure Dependent Mechanical Performance”**.

## ✨ What’s new compared to FN-DLS  
- **Bundling Recognition** – distinguishes individual fibrils from multi-fibril bundles.  
- **End-to-End Pipeline** – from raw AFM scan to quantitative network metrics in one call.
